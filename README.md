# Data science projects
Jon Tingvold

A collection of personal data science and machine learning projects, and mathematical/statistical insights.

Github loads jupyter notebooks quite slow, so it is probably better to view them on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/

Forecasting electricity load
----------------------------

[1 - Forecasting electricity load using temperature and Fbprophet (A generalized additive model with Fourier series)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Forecasting%20electricity%20load/1%20-%20Forecasting%20electricity%20load%20using%20temperature%20and%20Fbprophet%20%28Fourier%20and%20GAN%20model%29.ipynb)

[2 - Forecasting electricity load using a LSTM neural network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Forecasting%20electricity%20load/2%20-%20Forecasting%20electricity%20load%20using%20a%20LSTM%20neural%20network.ipynb)

Mathematical/statistical insights
---------------------------------

[Why software projects take longer than you think](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Insights%20-%20Why%20software%20projects%20take%20longer%20than%20you%20think/Why%20software%20projects%20take%20longer%20than%20you%20think.ipynb)

[When curse of dimensionality is a problem—and when it is not](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Insights%20-%20When%20curse%20of%20dimensionality%20is%20a%20problem—and%20when%20it%20is%20not/Insights%20-%20When%20curse%20of%20dimensionality%20is%20a%20problem—and%20when%20it%20is%20not.ipynb)

Data visualizations
