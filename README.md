# Data science projects
Jon Tingvold

A collection of personal data science and machine learning projects, and mathematical/statistical insights.

Mathematical/statistical insights
---------------------------------

[Why software projects take longer than you think](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Insights%20-%20Why%20software%20projects%20take%20longer%20than%20you%20think/Why%20software%20projects%20take%20longer%20than%20you%20think.ipynb)

[When curse of dimensionality is a problem—and when it is not](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Insights%20-%20When%20curse%20of%20dimensionality%20is%20a%20problem—and%20when%20it%20is%20not/Insights%20-%20When%20curse%20of%20dimensionality%20is%20a%20problem—and%20when%20it%20is%20not.ipynb)

Data visualizations
-------------------

[Supply and demand curves on Nord Pool](https://github.com/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Supply%20and%20demand%20curves%20on%20Nord%20Pool/README.md)

Forecasting electricity load
----------------------------

[1 - Forecasting electricity load using temperature and Fbprophet (A generalized additive model with Fourier series)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Forecasting%20electricity%20load/1%20-%20Forecasting%20electricity%20load%20using%20temperature%20and%20Fbprophet%20%28Fourier%20and%20GAN%20model%29.ipynb)

[2 - Forecasting electricity load using a LSTM neural network](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Forecasting%20electricity%20load/2%20-%20Forecasting%20electricity%20load%20using%20a%20LSTM%20neural%20network.ipynb)

Hydrological models
-------------------

[1 - Hydrological modeling with a simple LSTM network of 30 units](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/blob/master/Hydrological%20modeling%20with%20a%20simple%20LSTM%20network%20of%2030%20units/Hydrological%20modeling%20with%20a%20simple%20LSTM%20network%20of%2030%20units.ipynb)

[2 - SwiftHBV](https://github.com/jontingvold/swift-hbv). A HBV-model implemented with Swift with Simplex/Nelder–Mead to calibrate modelparameters.

*The links point to Nbviewer because Github loads jupyter notebooks quite slow and sometimes fail to load them entirely. If the links are broken you can find them on from [this repository's root on Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontingvold/datascience-projects/).*
